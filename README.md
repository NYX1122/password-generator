## Purpose
A site that generates completely randomized passwords based on user input.

* HTML
* CSS

## Description
I utilized javascript to create a perfect random password generator. I did this mainly by using functions and call-back functions, as well as objects and arrays. A valuable method I found was creating an array of functions, it allowed me to create logic that would have been quite impossibe otherwise. I also created randomizers that were made possible using the charAt method.
